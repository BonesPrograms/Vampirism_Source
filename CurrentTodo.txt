anyways:
Tempted to make Stealth Feed 10 turns, 1/2 damage, 1/2 feed rate, but the longer timer == increased likelihood of being spotted. Would be a new bool for Drink



SHould Myabe do PathDistanceTO

Wret kin... one day... LOL

Object.CurrentZone.CalculateLOS???? som opther shit too



feedtime may not need to exist anymore since the property works


Wassail hearing test

Wret kin/cybermod/esper rapid


Test Humanity

Dom bug

Echinoid witnesses


fix: witnesses that are hostile to the target wont attack you on alert. Also considering they only attack if allied. But exposure always happens
i should add strings to notify you if its a combat ending

cooldown bug

afaik deaths shouldnt roll if a companion gets bloody/killed by anyone else, only you----
especially with feed deaths
i could make humloss a popup so its easier to see in frenzy

GO forget

stealthfeed hostility/alliance checks, no noti if you cant see the witnesses, and uh, naming the one witness

humanity giving actions

player only autoget

defanging

tempted to make stealth feed have a double duration and take longet

TEST STEALTH FEED 

we could also add frenzy warning or a timer increment once it activates



void ToggleField<T>(T obj, string fieldName)
{
    var field = typeof(T).GetField(fieldName);
    if (field?.FieldType == typeof(bool))
    {
        bool value = (bool)field.GetValue(obj);
        field.SetValue(obj, !value);
        Console.WriteLine($"{fieldName} is now {(value ? "off" : "on")}.");
    }
}

test being defanged
i am concerned it will say "You defang yourself"
oh idea - just let any creature cut off any limb from me, and when the event fires, check for E.Actor, it doesnt need to specifically be under the face conditional

before we do wret kin check to see who base is in harmony
also i could patch the applicator and then have it apply a custom effect that inherits from the base one with slight modifications maybe

humanity test: bloodlet a watervine farmer (noncompanion)

what if you interrupt a feed using a HE grenade or something else that is indirect
MrBeast — 12/21/25, 11:39 PM
test ai interrupt

p sure like, if you dominate someone, their faction is temporarily considered friendly/allied to you, and you can get dunked for victim-abusing them

test bleeding a dominated victim to death against their own will

If you are feeding on someone as a vampire you dominated, they will get Victim (i dont think so, i only give victim if theyre a playeroriginalbody i think?)


weeps can not be witnesses anymore weeps can not be witnesses anymore weeps can not be witnesses anymore


test: are we collecting liquid volume off fractus directly


UPDATE: BLeeding should only make you lose blood if you take damage

what if you totally swap bodies to a vampire, and your og body is gone, what happens den fir hmanity

GETVisibilityRadius?

meditation / fasting way
other ways to expend blood
but then no metab
ooh i could just make that an option, but it would have to prob be a new part or something
no i would just want a new event in vitae easy
 
watches for active ability use, expends blood. refreshes active abilities by a certain number (or relative to the ability itself's cooldown) per sip/drink
so this would be easy - no metabolism, but if you use an active ability, you expend blood - VTM mode


test a victim dying due to bleeding after feeding, like bleeding as a result of feed attack
thnen fix bleed/dominationsuicide dath


and maybe just maybe there is a QuestCompleted event and a GaveToMechanimists event that i can use for hum regen
i could also tie hum regen to unique items or other ingame items
fasting way for blood, meidtation for hum maybe
maybe even some skills reduce hum regen time idk, could be a new skillset
yeah new skills - paths
If you come back and kill them as yourself, you will be dunked for it, despite not feeding on them

Should I use a more complex GetCombatTarget like OG stinger (hasnt been a problem yet)


attack a feeder, see if the victim's shit automatically breaks (if feed ends for him, or vampires kiss i guess, either one works now)
